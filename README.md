# Elixir for Programmers

Use your existing programming skills to get up to speed with Elixir. 
Then take it to the next level by learning “the Elixir way”. Projects, OTP, Phoenix, and more.

You're a programmer, so you don't need spoon feeding with the conventional drivel about "this is an integer." 
No. You need to know what's different, and you want to know quickly.

But you want more. 
True mastery of Elixir comes from understanding the underlying idioms: functional programming, 
transformations, concurrency, and application structure. You need to know the tools, such as IEx and mix. 
And you need to understand the frameworks, such as OTP and Phoenix. 
This course will get you started down this road (and your experience will take you the rest of the way).

The course has videos to show you stuff, text to give you facts, quizzes to help you remember, 
and exercises to let you practice.

More and more developers are switching to Elixir. Take this course and join them.
